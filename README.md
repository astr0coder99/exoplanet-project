# Exoplanet Project

Analyze data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive to explore confirmed exoplanets and their properties.

## Project Goals
-Use Python to load and clean exoplanet data, getting it ready for analysis.
-Look for patterns and trends that might help explain how planets form or behave in other solar systems.
-Demonstrate how key features like planet size, orbit length, and other factors relate to habitability.
-Gain hands-on experience in data science and astronomy by working with real data and applying machine learning.
