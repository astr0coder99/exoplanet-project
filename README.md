# Exoplanet Project

This project analyzes data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive to explore confirmed exoplanets and their properties.

## Project Goals
- Load and clean exoplanet data using Python
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends
- Visualize key exoplanet characteristics such as size, orbital period, and habitability factors
- Apply basic machine learning techniques to classify or predict exoplanet features

## Data Source
The dataset is sourced from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. A cleaned and filtered version (`Nasa Dataset (1).csv`) is included in this repository.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP
2. Open the `exoplanet_analysis.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. Run the cells to explore the data and analysis
