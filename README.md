# Exoplanet Project

This project analyzes data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive to explore confirmed exoplanets and their properties.

## Project Goals
- Load and clean exoplanet data using Python  
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends  
- Visualize key exoplanet characteristics such as size, orbital period, and habitability factors  
- Apply basic machine learning techniques to classify or predict exoplanet features (planned future work)  

## Data Source
Data is sourced from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository  
2. Download the dataset from the NASA Exoplanet Archive  
3. Open and run the `exoplanet_analysis.ipynb` notebook to explore the data and analysis steps
