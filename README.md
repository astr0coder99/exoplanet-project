# Exoplanet Project

This project analyzes data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive to explore confirmed exoplanets and their properties.

## Project Goals
- Load and clean exoplanet data using Python
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends
- Visualize key exoplanet characteristics such as size, orbital period, and habitability factors
- Apply basic machine learning techniques to classify or predict exoplanet features

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP
2 Open the (`Nasa_Dataset_Filtered_(3004_planets).ipynb`) notebook using Jupyter Notebook or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. Run the cells to explore the data and analysis

## Data Source
The dataset is sourced from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).  
A cleaned and filtered version (`filtered_exoplanets.csv`) is included in this repository.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
